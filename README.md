# #oneDay

> _Code_ everyday, _learn_ everyday!
>
> In this repository I challenge myself to create one project a day until I land a job.  
> #oneDay, **_Code_** everyday, **_learn_** everyday! This is a challenge to myself where I will try to create every day one small project (or if bigger over two or more days) until I land a position as a developer.
>
> (For the moment I focus on learning Vue.js and I'm not creating projects but they will come back)
>
> -   The important part of this challenge is that I _code_ everyday and _learn_ everyday. The same time I will document my journey.
> -   Every challenge needs to be documented with a **screenshot**, **description**, **what I used** to create the project, **what I learned** in the project and it needs to have a **start** and **finishing** date.
>
> -   _Optional_: Every 10th day I will create a summary where I will describe how the last 10 days went, if there was something I struggled with, if there is something I see that I get more comfortable with, if there is something significant that I learned and how I feel about the last days.
> -   If you are new to coding and you want to make sure that you code everyday and maybe get a job in the industry if that is something you would like then feel free to create your own oneDay repository and to share your projects with the community .
>
> -   If you do the challenge feel free to send me a link on Twitter to you project I would love to see what you created [@CodeWeis](https://twitter.com/CodeWeis) and put the #oneDayCodeEverydayLearnEveryday or come and join the [Facebook group](www.facebook.com/groups/onedaycode/)

> ### But donâ€™t forget the most important thing is HAVE FUN and learn everyday !!

# Update:

Today we are the 14th June, I started this repo almost one month ago and wanted to do an update, I started to learn Vue JS so I don't push a project everyday because it takes a bit time to find the answers to all the questions which come over the time of a project. But I get mor confident with the syntax and all the small details. To soon come back to one project a day for the moment I did update the [Crypto project](https://github.com/danyweis/cryptoProject) which is not in the list now but it has his own repo because it will become a bigger project .

Anyway I started my next project in Vue JS and it will be soon pushed.
